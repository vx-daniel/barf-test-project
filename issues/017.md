Add a `stringDiff` function to `src/index.ts` that returns a human-readable diff between two strings.

## Function

**`stringDiff(a: string, b: string): string`**
Returns a diff representation showing which characters were added or removed to transform `a` into `b`. Format TBD.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Returns an empty string when `a === b`
- [ ] Indicates additions and deletions in the output
- [ ] Handles multi-line strings
- [ ] Output format is documented
- [ ] Exported from `src/index.ts`
- [ ] Tests in `tests/stringDiff.test.ts`

## Blocker

Output format is not yet agreed upon. Options include unified diff format, a simple `+`/`-` prefix per changed word, or a character-level annotation. Blocked on format decision. Also unclear whether this should depend on `levenshteinDistance` (issue 016, also stuck) or use an independent LCS algorithm.
