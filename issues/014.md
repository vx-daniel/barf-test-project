Add a `parseCSV` function to `src/index.ts` that parses a CSV string into a 2D array of strings.

## Function

**`parseCSV(s: string): string[][]`**
Parses a CSV-formatted string. Each line becomes a row; each comma-delimited value becomes a cell.

Examples:
```
parseCSV('a,b,c\n1,2,3')  → [['a','b','c'],['1','2','3']]
parseCSV('"foo,bar",baz')  → [['foo,bar','baz']]
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Splits rows on newline
- [ ] Splits cells on comma
- [ ] Quoted fields containing commas are handled correctly
- [ ] Escaped quotes (`""`) inside quoted fields are unescaped
- [ ] Trailing newline does not produce an empty row
- [ ] Exported from `src/index.ts`
- [ ] Tests in `tests/parseCSV.test.ts`

## Blocker

Stuck on quoted-field edge cases — specifically multiline quoted fields and escaped-quote sequences. Needs a decision on whether to support RFC 4180 fully or a simplified subset before implementation can continue.
