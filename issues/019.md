Add a set of basic string transformation utilities to `src/index.ts`.

Original scope included `repeat`, `reverse`, and several other transformations. Split into focused sub-issues due to scope.

## Original Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All sub-issues completed
- [ ] Functions exported from `src/index.ts`
- [ ] Full test coverage

## Sub-issues

- 004: `repeat(s, n)`
- 005: `reverse(s)`
