Add string shortening and padding utilities to `src/index.ts`.

Original scope bundled truncation, padding, and alignment helpers into one issue. Split after planning revealed each area warranted independent test coverage.

## Original Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All sub-issues completed
- [ ] Functions exported from `src/index.ts`
- [ ] Full test coverage

## Sub-issues

- 008: `truncate(s, maxLen, suffix?)`
- 009: `camelCase(s)`
