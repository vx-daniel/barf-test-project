## Description
Implement factorial and fibonacci functions.

Factorial is done. Fibonacci is still WIP.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `factorial(n)` returns n!, throws on negative input
- [ ] `fibonacci(n)` returns the nth Fibonacci number
- [ ] Fibonacci handles n=0 and n=1 base cases
- [ ] Tests for both functions
