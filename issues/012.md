Add a `countOccurrences` function to `src/index.ts`.

## Function

**`countOccurrences(s: string, sub: string): number`**
Returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of `sub` in `s`.

Examples:
```
countOccurrences('hello world hello', 'hello')   → 2
countOccurrences('aaaa', 'aa')                   → 2
countOccurrences('abcabc', 'xyz')                → 0
countOccurrences('hello', '')                    → 0
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Returns correct count of non-overlapping occurrences
- [ ] `countOccurrences(s, '')` returns `0`
- [ ] Returns `0` when `sub` not found
- [ ] Matches are non-overlapping (`'aaaa'` / `'aa'` → `2`, not `3`)
- [ ] Case-sensitive by default
- [ ] Exported from `src/index.ts`
- [ ] Tests in `tests/countOccurrences.test.ts`
