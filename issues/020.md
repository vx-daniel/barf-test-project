Add a set of string inspection and trimming utilities to `src/index.ts`.

Original scope included palindrome detection, custom trim variants, and additional string predicates. Split into focused sub-issues due to scope.

## Original Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All sub-issues completed
- [ ] Functions exported from `src/index.ts`
- [ ] Full test coverage

## Sub-issues

- 006: `isPalindrome(s)`
- 007: `ltrim(s, chars?)` and `rtrim(s, chars?)`
