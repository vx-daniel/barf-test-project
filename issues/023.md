Add string analysis and formatting tools to `src/index.ts`.

Original scope combined occurrence counting, padding utilities, and string metrics into one issue. Split to allow parallel implementation of independent functions.

## Original Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All sub-issues completed
- [ ] Functions exported from `src/index.ts`
- [ ] Full test coverage

## Sub-issues

- 012: `countOccurrences(s, sub)`
- 013: `padStart(s, n, char?)` and `padEnd(s, n, char?)`
