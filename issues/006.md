## Description
Implement greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) functions.

## Blocker
Performance requirements are undefined. Need to decide:
- Should we support BigInt or just regular numbers?
- What is the maximum input size we need to handle?
- Is the Euclidean algorithm sufficient or do we need a faster approach?

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `gcd(a, b)` returns the greatest common divisor
- [ ] `lcm(a, b)` returns the least common multiple
- [ ] Handle edge cases (zero inputs, negative numbers)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass (TBD)
