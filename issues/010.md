## Description
Implement number formatting utilities including comma separation, percentage formatting, currency formatting, and scientific notation.

This issue is too large for a single build — `force_split=true` will trigger automatic decomposition.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `formatWithCommas(n)` adds thousand separators
- [ ] `formatPercent(n, decimals?)` formats as percentage
- [ ] `formatCurrency(n, currency?)` formats as currency string
- [ ] `toScientific(n, precision?)` formats in scientific notation
- [ ] Tests for all formatters with locale edge cases
