## Description
Implement a comprehensive unit conversion suite covering length, weight, and volume.

This issue is too large for a single build — `force_split=true` will trigger automatic decomposition into sub-issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Length conversions (meters, feet, inches, km, miles)
- [ ] Weight conversions (kg, lbs, oz, grams)
- [ ] Volume conversions (liters, gallons, cups, ml)
- [ ] Generic `convert(value, from, to)` API
- [ ] Tests for all conversion types
